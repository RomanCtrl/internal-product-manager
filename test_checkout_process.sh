# --- Expected Verifications ---

# 1. orders table insertion
echo "VERIFY 1: A new row is inserted into 'orders' table."
echo "  - Expected: user_id = ${USER_ID}"
echo "  - Expected: cart_id = ${CART_ID}" # Assuming cart_id is stored on the order for reference
echo "  - Expected: total_amount = ${CART_TOTAL}"
echo "  - Expected: status = 'pending' (or initial default)"
echo "  - Expected: order_number is generated (e.g., ORD-timestamp)"
# Simulate capturing this ID. In a real scenario, this would come from the DB insert.
NEW_ORDER_ID="mock-order-id-$(date +%sN)"
echo "  - Simulated NEW_ORDER_ID = ${NEW_ORDER_ID}"

# 2. order_items table insertion
echo "VERIFY 2: Rows are inserted into 'order_items' table for NEW_ORDER_ID=${NEW_ORDER_ID}."
echo "  - Item 1 (from ${PRODUCT_1_ID}):"
echo "    - Expected: order_id = ${NEW_ORDER_ID}"
echo "    - Expected: product_id = '${PRODUCT_1_ID}'"
echo "    - Expected: quantity = ${PRODUCT_1_QUANTITY}"
echo "    - Expected: unit_price = ${PRODUCT_1_PRICE_AT_TIME}"

echo "    - Expected: unit_price = ${PRODUCT_2_PRICE_AT_TIME}"
echo "    - Expected: total_price = ${PRODUCT_2_TOTAL_PRICE}"

# 3. carts table update
echo "VERIFY 3: The 'carts' table row for CART_ID=${CART_ID} is updated."
echo "  - Expected: status = 'completed'" # Or 'processed', 'archived', etc.

# 4. cart_items table deletion
# This is often part of the checkout logic, e.g., clearCart() or handled by a DB trigger.
echo "VERIFY 4: All items are effectively removed from the active cart (e.g., 'cart_items' for CART_ID=${CART_ID} are deleted or cart status makes them inactive)."
echo "  - Expected: SELECT * FROM cart_items WHERE cart_id = ${CART_ID} AND status = 'active' (or similar logic) should return 0 rows OR"
echo "  - Expected: The cart itself (carts table) being marked 'completed' means items are no longer considered 'active cart items'."


# 5. Return Value
echo "VERIFY 5: The createOrderFromCart function (or equivalent checkout function) returns the new order details or ID."
echo "  - Expected: Return value likely includes '${NEW_ORDER_ID}' and possibly total_amount, status."

# 6. Context State Update (Post Checkout)
echo "VERIFY 6: CartContext state is updated after checkout."
echo "  - Expected: items array is empty."
echo "  - Expected: itemCount (sum of quantities) is 0."
echo "  - Expected: cartTotal is 0."
echo "  - Expected: cartId might be cleared or a new one generated for subsequent shopping."
echo "    (Current CartContext.tsx clears cartId to null and fetches/creates a new one on next add-to-cart)"


# --- Error Handling Scenario (Conceptual) ---
echo ""
echo "--- Error Handling Scenario ---"
echo "VERIFY SCENARIO (Error): Attempt to checkout with an empty cart."
# Simulate cart is empty (itemCount === 0)
echo "  - If cart is empty (e.g., itemCount is 0 before calling createOrderFromCart):"
echo "  - Expected: createOrderFromCart (or equivalent) should ideally return null or throw an error early."
echo "  - Expected: No database operations (INSERTs into 'orders'/'order_items', UPDATEs to 'carts') should occur for order creation."
echo "  - Expected: An appropriate user message like 'Cannot create order: Cart is empty' or 'User not fully logged in' (if applicable)."
