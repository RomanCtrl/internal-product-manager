# --- Expected Verifications ---

# 1. Supabase UPDATE command for Order Cancellation
echo "VERIFY 1: An UPDATE command is issued to the 'orders' table to cancel the order."
echo "  - Expected SQL: UPDATE orders"
echo "  - Expected SQL SET clause: SET status = 'cancelled', updated_at = (current_timestamp_function)"
echo "  - Expected SQL WHERE clause: WHERE id = '${ORDER_ID_TO_CANCEL}' AND user_id = '${USER_ID}'"
echo "  - Note: The user_id check in the WHERE clause is crucial for ensuring a user can only cancel their own orders."
echo "  - Note: The OrdersPage.tsx implementation correctly includes .eq('user_id', user.id) in its Supabase update call."
echo ""

# 2. Post-cancellation Data Refresh
echo "VERIFY 2: The fetchOrders() function (or equivalent data refresh mechanism) is called after the update attempt."
echo "  - Purpose: To update the order list in the OrdersPage component's state with the latest order statuses."
echo ""

# 3. Verification of Order Status After Refresh
echo "VERIFY 3: The order with ID ${ORDER_ID_TO_CANCEL}, when re-fetched from the database, should have its status as 'cancelled'."
echo "  - Conceptual Database Check: A query like \"SELECT status FROM orders WHERE id = '${ORDER_ID_TO_CANCEL}'\" should return 'cancelled'."
echo "  - Client-Side State Check: The corresponding order object in the OrdersPage component's state (e.g., 'orders' array) should reflect order_status: 'cancelled'."
echo ""

# 4. UI Behavior for Cancelled Order (Conceptual)
echo "VERIFY 4: The User Interface should correctly reflect the cancelled state of the order."
echo "  - The 'Cancel Order' button should no longer be visible or should be disabled for this specific order (since it's no longer in 'pending' status)."
echo "  - The displayed status for the order should clearly indicate 'Cancelled'."
echo "  - Styling for the 'Cancelled' status might change (e.g., text color to red, as suggested by a getStatusColor function in the UI code)."
echo ""

# 5. Attempt to Cancel an Order Not in 'Pending' State (Conceptual - UI Guard)
# The current handleCancelOrder function in OrdersPage.tsx directly attempts the update without an explicit pre-check of the order's current status.
# It relies on the UI logic (conditional rendering of the cancel button) to prevent cancellation of non-pending orders.
echo "VERIFY 5 (Conceptual - UI Guard): If the handleCancelOrder function were somehow invoked for an order not in 'pending' state (e.g., 'shipped' or 'delivered'):"
echo "  - The Supabase UPDATE command (as in VERIFY 1) would still be attempted."
echo "  - If the order status was, for example, 'shipped', it would be changed to 'cancelled' by this operation (assuming no other database constraints prevent this)."
echo "  - This highlights that the primary safeguard against inappropriate cancellations is the conditional rendering of the 'Cancel Order' button in the UI (i.e., only showing it for orders with status 'pending')."
echo ""

echo "Subtask finished. These VERIFY statements outline the checks for the order cancellation functionality."
