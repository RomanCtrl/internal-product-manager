# Protected routes as defined in middleware.ts config matcher (excluding /auth paths and /)
# For this test, we'll list common protected application paths.
# Note: /products is listed in the input, but in the actual middleware.ts,
# it seems to be protected if the user is *not* authenticated and tries to access it.
# The middleware redirects to /login if user is not authenticated for paths like /products, /cart, /orders.
PROTECTED_ROUTES=("/cart" "/orders" "/products") # Assuming /products is also protected when unauthenticated

echo "--- Test Case 2: Unauthenticated user attempting cart operations ---"
echo "  Simulating calls to CartContext functions (e.g., addToCart, updateQuantity, removeFromCart, getOrCreateCartId) without a logged-in user."
echo "  VERIFY (CartContext): Functions like 'addToCart', 'updateQuantity', 'removeFromCart' include checks such as 'if (!user || !cartId)' or 'if (!user || !currentCartId)'."
echo "  VERIFY (CartContext): These checks would typically cause the function to return early or not perform the main logic if user or essential cart ID is missing."
echo "  VERIFY (CartContext): Consequently, no Supabase calls that modify 'carts' or 'cart_items' tables should be initiated from these functions for an unauthenticated user."
echo "  VERIFY (CartContext): The cart state within the CartContext (e.g., items, itemCount, cartTotal, cartId) would remain in its initial empty/null state or would not be successfully populated."
echo "  VERIFY (CartContext): The 'getOrCreateCartId' function specifically checks 'if (!user)', and if true, it calls 'clearCart', logs a message, and returns null. This prevents cart creation for unauthenticated users."
